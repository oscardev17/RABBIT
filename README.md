# RABBIT üêá

In a context where cyberattacks increasingly target software and websites, securing databases is a key issue. Companies must protect sensitive information against threats such as SQL injection attacks, data leaks and unauthorized access, while ensuring optimal performance for their online services.

## Features

- Proprietary encryption algorithm, highly secure and hard to bypass.
- Data encryption in transit (`TLS`) and at rest (`AES-256`).
- Secure key management system (`KMS`) with automated key rotation.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (`MFA`) for added security.
- Role-Based Access Control (`RBAC`) to limit unauthorized access.
- Login activity monitoring for anomaly detection.
- Automatic alerts for suspicious activity.
- Compatible with `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB`, and other databases.
- Secure `API`s for seamless integration into apps and websites.
- Regular automated backups and disaster recovery plans.
